# OpenFasoc   
Fully-Autonomous SoC Synthesis using Customizable Cell-Based Synthesizable Analog Circuits.
The SoC synthesis tool realizes analog circuits, including PLLs, power management, ADCs, and sensor interfaces by recasting them as structures composed largely of digital components while maintaining analog performance. 
OpenFASOC is focused on open-source automate analog generation from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools. This project is led by a team of researchers at the University of Michigan is inspired from FASoC whcih sits on proprietary tools.

## Run Openfasoc Flow   

before that-

1.  cd into the directory where the OpenFASoC repository was cloned;

    Now edit the openfasoc/common/platform_config.json file, replacing the open_pdks value with the path to the sky130A/ directory from open_pdks;
    
2. copy  /home/aditya/fasoc/openfasoc/openfasoc/OpenROAD/build/src/openroad  /home/aditya/fasoc/openfasoc/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/tools/install/OpenROAD/bin/openroad

3. edit /fasoc/openfasoc/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/flow/Makefile at line 657 python to python3.9 or python3.8 which is present at your computer/bin/ 

4. edit /fasoc/openfasoc/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/flow/Makefile , insert a line at 167 export OPENROAD_EXE = /home/aditya/fasoc/openfasoc/openfasoc/generators/temp-sense-gen/tools/install/OpenROAD/bin/openroad


After that   

run flow-

The generator references the model files in an iterative process until either meeting specifications or failing.     
the tool is trying to minimize the error iteratively, by varying the number of inverters and headers for the given temperature range.

## Temperature Sensor Generator   

Circuit   
-------
This generator creates a compact mixed-signal temperature sensor based on the topology from this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9816083).   

It consists of a ring oscillator whose frequency is controlled by the voltage drop over a MOSFET operating in subthreshold regime, where its dependency on temperature is exponential.

### OpenFASOC Flow

The steps from the RTL-to-GDS flow look like this, usual in a digital flow:

The default circuit’s physical design generation can be divided into three parts:

 1. Verilog generation     

 2. RTL-to-GDS flow (OpenROAD)     

 3. Post-layout verification (DRC and LVS)     

### Verilog generation   

Running make sky130hd_temp (temp for “temperature sensor”) executes the temp-sense-gen.py script from temp-sense-gen/tools/. This file takes the input specifications from test.json and outputs Verilog files containing the description of the circuit.

The generator starts from a Verilog template of the temperature sensor circuit, located in temp-sense-gen/src/. The .v template files have lines marked with @@, which are replaced according to the specifications.

User Specs    

Temperature sensing range: -20⁰C – 125⁰C    

Frequency range of operation: 100Hz – 10MHz    

* Inputs

1. CLK_REF: System clock taken from input.

2. RESET_COUNTERn: Input signal to reset the module initial state.

3. SEL_CONV_TIME: Four bit input used to select how many times the 1 bit of the output DOUT is fractionated (0-16).

* Outputs

1. DOUT: The output voltage whose frequency is dependent on temperature.

2. DONE: Validity signal for DOUT

Theses are the verilog template files which are used for the creation of netlist verilog files.    

We use an all-digital temperature sensor architecture, that relies on a new subthreshold oscillator (achieved using the auxiliary cell “Header Cell“) for realizing synthesizable thermal sensors. We choose frequency as the temperature dependent variable. So, we use a ring oscillators that is based on inverters only and stacked native IO devices for better line sensitivity.    
Since the subthreshold current has an exponential dependency on the temperature, the frequency generated from the subthreshold ring oscillator is also dependent on temperature. Using this principle, we can sense the temperature by comparing the clock generated from a reference oscillator and the clock frequency from our proposed frequency generator.
